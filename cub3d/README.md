# cub3d

## Production period.
- (22.01.17 ~ 22.02.23)

## Description
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting.
Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.

### Keywords
- Applicative
### Skills
- Graphics
- Rigor
- Imperative programming
- Algorithms & AI

## Goals
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

## Mandatory Part
### Function name 
- cub3D
### Turn in files 
- All your files
### Makefile
- all, clean, fclean, re, bonus
### External functs.
- open, close, read, write,
printf, malloc, free, perror,
strerror, exit
- All functions of the math
library (-lm man man 3 math)
- All functions of the MinilibX
### Libft authorized
- yes
### Description
- You must create a “realistic” 3D graphical
representation of the inside of a maze from a
first-person perspective. You have to create this
representation using the Ray-Casting principles
mentioned earlier.

## Map Info
- Each element (except the map) firsts information is the type identifier (composed by one or two character(s)), followed by all specific informations for each
object in a strict order such as :
  - North texture: NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
    - identifier: NO
    - path to the north texure
  - South texture: SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
    - identifier: SO
    - path to the south texure
  - West texture: WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
    - identifier: WE
    - path to the west texure
  - East texture: EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
    - identifier: EA
    - path to the east texure
  - Floor color: F 220,100,0
    - identifier: F
    - R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255
  - Ceilling color: C 225,30,0
    - identifier: C
    - R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255
