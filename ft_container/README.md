# ft_container

## Production period.
- (22.04.24 ~ 22.05.29)

## Description
The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. To make sure you understand them all, let's re-implement them!

### Keywords
- OOP
### Skills
- Object-oriented programming
- Rigor

## Objectives
- In this project, you will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template
library.
- You have to take the structure of each standard container as reference. If a part of
the Orthodox Canonical form is missing in it, do not implement it.
- As a reminder, you have to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of
the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated
ones) is expected.

## Mandatory Part
Implement the following containers and turn in the necessary <container>.hpp files:
- vector\
    You donâ€™t have to do the vector<bool> specialization.
- map
- stack \
It will use your vector class as default underlying container. But it must still be
compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.

#### You also have to implement:
- iterators_traits
- reverse_iterator
- enable_if \
Yes, it is C++11 but you will be able to implement it in a C++98 manner.
This is asked so you can discover SFINAE.
- is_integral
- equal and/or lexicographical_compare
- std::pair
- std::make_pair

## Requirements
- The namespace must be ft.
- Each inner data structure used in your containers must be logical and justified (this
means using a simple array for map is not ok).
- You cannot implement more public functions than the ones offered in the standard
containers. Everything else must be private or protected. Each public function or
variable must be justified.
- All the member functions, non-member functions and overloads of the standard
containers are expected.
- You must follow the original naming. Take care of details.
- If the container has an iterator system, you must implement it.
- You must use std::allocator.
- For non-member overloads, the keyword friend is allowed. Each use of friend
must be justified and will be checked during evaluation.
- Of course, for the implementation of map::value_compare, the keyword friend is
allowed.

## Testing
- You must also provide tests, at least a main.cpp, for your defense. You have to go
further than the main given as example!
- You must produce two binaries that run the same tests: one with your containers
only, and the other one with the STL containers.
- Compare outputs and performance / timing (your containers can be up to 20
times slower).
- Test your containers with: ft::<container>.
